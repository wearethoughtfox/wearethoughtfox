With the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) we designed and developed a project to map the work of the world&#8217;s leading sexual & reproductive health rights provider.

The maps are light and fast, built in HTML, JavaScript, GeoJson-formatted data, hosted on Github pages and editable using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/). This approach is fast and robust because it using static files and doesn’t need a database. It also opens up the data for other people to use.

The maps are simple, clear and easy to use. [See for yourself on the IPPF&#8217;s website](http://www.ippf.org/our-work/impact).

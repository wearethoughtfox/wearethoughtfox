  Here&#8217;s a selection of what&#8217;s sparked our curiosity, piqued our interest and made us shudder (almost) with delight this week.

Una liked the way the Arrels Foundation have created a collection of typefaces based on the handwriting of homeless.

She also enjoyed this talk about the story of Airbnb and the growth of the sharing economy.

And finally from Una: a video of Tina RothEisenberg talking about side projects which turned into “labors of love”.

## The Internet with a Human Face

I found much to chew over in [this great talk](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm) by Maciej Cegłowski (of [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/)) from Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany. Here&#8217;s a few choice morsels:

> a lot of what&#8217;s wrong with the Internet has to do with memory. The Internet somehow contrives to remember too much and too little at the same time, and it maps poorly on our concepts of how memory should work. [&#8230;]

> One reason there&#8217;s a backlash against Google glasses is that they try to bring the online rules into the offline world [&#8230;] Google&#8217;s answer is, wake up, grandpa, this is the new normal. But all they&#8217;re doing is trying to port a bug in the Internet over to the real world, and calling it progress. You can dress up a bug and call it a feature. You can also put dog crap in the freezer and call it ice cream. But people can taste the difference. [&#8230;]

> These big collections of personal data are like radioactive waste. It&#8217;s easy to generate, easy to store in the short term, incredibly toxic, and almost impossible to dispose of. Just when you think you&#8217;ve buried it forever, it comes leaching out somewhere unexpected. [&#8230;]

> One of the worst aspects of surveillance is how it limits our ability to be creative with technology. It&#8217;s like a tax we all have to pay on innovation. We can&#8217;t have cool things, because they&#8217;re too potentially invasive.

I also enjoyed [this talk on generalists and trans-media by Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/talks/designing-in-the-borderlands/transcript/) which gave me hope as a incurably curious generalist lurching from interest to interest and feeling inadequate in the face of specialists.

I still believe that:

> Major innovation comes from the unexplored no-man&#8217;s-land between the disciplines

<cite>&#8211; Norbert Weiner</cite>

and point anyone in doubt in the direction of [James Burke&#8217;s dConstruct talk from 2012](http://2012.dconstruct.org/conference/burke/).

Finally, here&#8217;s a [great article about &#8220;Bots of conviction&#8221;](https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa) with some interesting guidance on creating Twitter bots which have meaning and are effective for protest.

Here&#8217;s a medley of curious threads we have pulled into our browsers this week.

1. Una found a kind of a morbid one but fascinating [article about what happens to your online identity after you die](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/social-networking-death.htm).
2. She also discovered the [world&#8217;s first light art museum](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/take-an-electrifying-look-inside-the-worlds-first-light-art-museum), the [digital art renaissance](http://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/read/think-pieces/3708/digital-revolution) and [redesigned parking sign](http://www.wired.com/2014/07/a-redesigned-parking-sign-so-simple-youll-never-get-towed-again/). Yes, finally!
3. Rob&#8217;s discovered [Longplayer](http://longplayer.org), a one thousand year long musical composition. [The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill made it through parliament in the UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/house-of-commons-28311912) despite lots of people (myself included) writing to their MPs. Ho hum. We&#8217;ll have to find other ways to defend our rights to privacy, such as this [online privacy pack](https://pack.resetthenet.org/) courtesy of Reset The Net.

* Hierarchy - broad to narrow tree relationship
* Database - similar things - get to know the things in different ways. Pieces are the same and there's lots of different ways to get to them - metadata / attributes. 
* Hypertext - pieces related by relationships in content 
* Linear - not on the web much. book, walking 
* Catalogue = database sitting on top of hierarchy 
* Hub and spoke - search results

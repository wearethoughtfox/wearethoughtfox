We worked with Middle East art fair Art Dubai on their digital media strategy.

In a consulting role for Art Dubai, we began with a list of improvements and items to establish process for their website. We developed foundation elements such as a blog and a searchable photo archive as well as first time elements like interview videos for Global Art Forum, supplying daily video footage for TV coverage and working with partners creating interactive maps of the fair.

Working with former Art Dubai marketing consultant Stephanie Sykes, we commissioned, edited, photographed and/or wrote the establishing posts for the blog.

As well as hiring and directing photographers and videographers we provided support to all Art Dubai departments before, during and after the fair.

In addition to consulting for Art Dubai we also worked on their sister fairs Design Days Dubai and Sikka Art Fair.

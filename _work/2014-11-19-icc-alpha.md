The International Criminal Court approached us to lead a digital project to create a new website.

We followed an agile approach guided by user needs. We conducted research and analysis &#8211; interviews, surveys, search logs and analytics &#8211; to determine the shape of the alpha and instill a ruthless adherence to serving user needs.

We helped put together a team and we worked remotely following an agile approach to build a prototype of the most important parts of the site. The site took four months to design and build and was tested on a variety of users around the world. ICC Beta began later in the year.

You can read more about the project on [the development blog](http://new-icc.tumblr.com) (which was http://new-icc.tumblr.com but has now been moved to this site) and on [Github](https://github.com/robertocarroll/icc-alpha/).

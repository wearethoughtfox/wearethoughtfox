Every year Amnesty International release data on death penalties and executions around the world. They wanted to display this data in a way which was easy to understand. They also wanted people to be able to access the data and perhaps use it in their own work. We Are Thought Fox designed and built [these maps](http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012) in 2011 and in 2012 to give people an overview of the countries with the death penalty and allow them to explore the most recent figures. We used Google Fusion to map the data and created a custom map. We also made [an interactive map](http://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/making-rights-law/making-rights-law) for The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol), which allows individuals and groups to seek justice from the UN if their rights are violated and their government does not provide justice. People can see the status of countries and explore case studies.

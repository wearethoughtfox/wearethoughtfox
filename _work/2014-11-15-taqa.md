We worked with TAQA to create a [new website](http://taqaglobal.com/) for this global energy company. We analysed search logs and analytics to determine the most important user needs and help TAQA and their digital agency make decisions based on evidence.

We worked with TAQA’s teams in Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, Morocco, UAE and Iraq gathering requirements, creating sketches, wireframes and new content for various sections of the website.

We also [designed and developed a new map](http://www.taqaglobal.com/our-regions?sc_lang=en) to show TAQA’s operations around the world.

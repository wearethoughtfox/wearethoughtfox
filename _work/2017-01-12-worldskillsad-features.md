excerpt: Concept, design and development of inspiring stories
---

We developed this monthly series about young Emiratis who have transformed their lives with vocational skills.

The stories inspired students in the UAE with the possibilities of vocational skills from robotics to jewellery to engineering.

Each story was published in English and Arabic and included images and a video. As well as worldskillsabudhabi2017.com, the stories were syndicated to The National and Atlas, the inflight magazine by Etihad Airways.
